				<h4>Step 1:</h4>
				<p>
				    Enter your relation algebra into an input field.<br>
					You need to follow the defined grammar for inputing queries correctly.<br>
					<br>
					
					For Select operator, just enter as normally in relational algebra and do not need to put bracket
					on a result relation except those from binary operators such Union, Join, etc. This is similar to Project operator.<br>
					Eg:<br>
					σ age>23 USERS<br>
					σ name="long" σ salary=1000 USERS<br>
					π name,address (USERS ⋈mms=nns WORKER)<br>
					<br>
					
					For any binary operators, the format is stil the same as the relational algebra in database. You need to be carefull with brackets with this kind of operator.
					Union, Intersection and Production does need to separate by brackets cause they are commutative and associative. In contrast, Left_Join, Right_Join and Join 
					require bracket between each pair of them because the way they are grouped will affect their intermediate results<br>
					Eg:<br>
					STAFF ⋃ STUDENT ⋃ TEACHER<br>
					(STAFF ⋈a=b STUDENT) ⋈c=d TEACHER<br>
					(STAFF ⋂ STUDENT) ⋈c=d TEACHER<br>
					<br>
					
					If you apply this kind of operator on intermediate results from selection or projection, bracket is again
                    not necessary. When you try to type unecessary brackets to the input field, the system will notify a syntax error.<br>
                    Eg:<br>
                    σ age>23 STAFF ⋂ π name,address STUDENT<br>
                    <br>
                    
                    <b>Note:</b> all comparison symbol (>,<,=,≥,≤,≠) used in the application is as same as in Java and also the string is distinguished by double quotes " surrounding it.  			
                </p>
                
				<h4>Step 2:</h4>
				<p>
				    Click on "Generate Tree" button to view an output query tree.<br>
					Click on "Highlight Tree" button to see inefficencies with a input query.<br>
					Save and open the query trees by press "File" icon on the top-left corner<br>of the main application window.<br>
					You can zoom in and out to view the tree graph flexibly by click on the list of items on the "Tools" menu adjacent to "File" icon.<br>
                    To get information and guidline, hit "Help?" next to the "File" icon.					
				</p>
				
				<h3>2.Developer:</h3>
				<p>
				    My application stil got many problems about performance and need to develop more useful functions for users.
					The best way to improve software applications is to invoke a large group of developers working together
					because of reducing a chance of getting bug as well as integrating more positive ideas. As the result,
                    i have decided to put my source code on GitHub so anyone interested in my application can download and enhance the application.
