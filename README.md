# Relational Algebra Visualizer
**Relational Algebra Visualizer** is a Java application which is used mainly to translate a Relational Algebra query into a query tree for IT learners. Moreover, the application is also able to hightlight inefficencies within the query as well as allows users to save the tree graph for later purposes. In term of implementation, it was integrated with generated code from JFlex, CUP and DJNativeSwing library.  

The tool has been developed by **Ngoc Duy Pham** for the final year project supervised by **Dr. Floriana** and **Dr. David** at **University of Liverpool**.  

In addition, a big thank to **Dr. Maduka** who suggested me many helpfull ideas to accomplish this project.
